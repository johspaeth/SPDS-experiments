# Setup instructions

Import all projects as maven projects in eclipse. If not possible, import them as regular eclipse projects.

Specify the directory of your java runtime in the file [safe.properties](https://github.com/johspaeth/ideal-safe/blob/de36767837b0bf4a1ac5509e5cf3c4eb732c62b1/com.ibm.safe.core.tests/dat/safe.properties)


``java_runtime_dir = path_to_jre``
